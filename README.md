# On-Off-Board Automation

## 📌 Overview

This project automates the **onboarding and offboarding** process for employees using an integrated DevOps workflow.  
Instead of manually provisioning environments, tracking tasks, or sending updates, the system allows HR or IT to simply **add or modify an employee YAML file** in the `employees/` folder.

A Jenkins pipeline automatically detects the file change and triggers:

- Creating or removing a **Docker workspace** for the employee  
- Updating the employee’s status  
- Creating or updating **Jira tickets** (To Do → In Progress → Done)  
- Sending notifications through a **Webex bot**  
- Running validation scripts and cleanup tasks  

This demonstrates real-world DevOps automation, CI/CD, and API integration.
